### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Soojin Kim, a passionate and self-taught full-stack web developer!

I'm all about the exciting world of front-end and back-end development. I may not have a ton of professional experience just yet, but I'm a quick learner, always up for a challenge, and ready to bring my enthusiasm to any dynamic team.

I've built a strong foundation in web development through self-study and hands-on projects. From diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to exploring frameworks like React and Express, I've tackled it all. I'm eager to keep expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.

I believe in continuous growth and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. I'm here to make a mark, create awesome web experiences, and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Let's connect and collaborate! Reach out to me on GitHub or drop me a message. Together, we can create something extraordinary! ðŸš€
